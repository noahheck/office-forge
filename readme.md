# Office Forge

## Goal

The Office Forge platform is an online business management platform designed to put business owners in control of their data. It provides tools for process and task management, file storage, communication and collaboration, and scheduling, while being straightforward to customize and maintain.

### Process Management

The Process Management System in Office Forge is a tool allowing administrators to document the steps required to complete a business process, monitor the progress of those processes as they're completed by staff, and make updates to a process as business needs change. This helps ensure that the work that needs to get done is getting done, and helps identify opportunities for improvement.

### Files

The Files System allows administrators to organize the information that's important to the business in the way that best expresses their competitive advantages. There are tools for collecting, tracking, and sharing the information staff members need to do their work correctly and efficiently.
